              <h2>Predictive Potato Storage</h2>
              <p>
                Our flagship solution transforms potato storage through proprietary sensors that
                feed machine learning models. By collecting comprehensive data from every deployment,
                our system learns to predict spoilage before it happensâ€”enabling operators to
                intervene and prevent loss entirely.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working with leading food processors, every storage facility we deploy makes our
                predictions more accurate. The data collected continuously refines our models,
                creating an increasingly intelligent system that anticipates problems and recommends
                preventive actions before any product is compromised.
